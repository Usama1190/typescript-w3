// TypeScript Casting

/* Casting with as
A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the as keyword, which 
will directly change the type of the given variable. */

// let x: unknown = 'hello';

// console.log((x as string).length);






/* Casting with <>
Using <> works the same as casting with as. */
